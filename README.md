## :bulb: About the project

The goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of the features and capabilities offered by NestJS while applying software concepts, architecture principles, and best practices. 

For now, I've been considering the following approaches:

- Writing unit tests for services, repositories, domain classes containing crucial logic, utility classes, etc.
- integration/e2e tests for endpoints using real implementations as much as possible.
- Using Docker to construct the test database environment every time an e2e test is executed.
- Implementing a dedicated layer for IAM.
- Implementing authentication using email and password, social login with Google, and also 2FA.
- Implementing dynamic refresh tokens.
- Implementing roles and permissions authorization.
- Shifting the focus less on clean architecture and more on DDD for this project.

## :bulb: Requirements
