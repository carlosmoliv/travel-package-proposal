<h1 style="text-align: center;">Travel Package Proposal API </h1>

### Notes: 
- The project is currently under construction.
- I'm currently refactoring the existing monolithic structure into microservices. 
   

## :bulb: About the project

The goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of the features and capabilities offered by NestJS while applying software concepts, architecture principles, and best practices. 

For now, I've been considering the following approaches:

- Writing unit tests for services, repositories, domain classes containing crucial logic, utility classes, etc.
- Integration/e2e tests for endpoints using real implementations as much as possible.
- Using Docker to construct the services environment every time an e2e test is executed.
- Implementing a dedicated microservice for IAM.
- Implementing authentication using email and password, social login with Google, and also 2FA feature.
- Implementing dynamic refresh tokens including in-memory token storage.
- Implementing a more robust authorization flow with permissions and roles.
- New Focus: 
  - Incorporating microservices, serverless architecture, and related functionalities to gain a deeper understanding of how these components work together in a real-world project, including refactoring existing monolithic components into microservices. 
  - Deploying the application using AWS cloud features, with a particular focus on Lambda functions for serverless execution.

### Running the application
The project has been refactored into a microservices architecture within a monorepo. The instructions for running the application are currently being updated to reflect this new structure.
